# Third-Party Notices

Upstream inventory retained below. Historical `LICENSES/...` and Weport-specific
paths do not imply identical files are shipped by this branch. Current license
copies and artifact scope are indexed in
[branch provenance](../../docs/LEGAL-PROVENANCE.md), including the bundled Noto
font and Mac key helpers. Original attribution is preserved.

Weport is an adapted work distributed under the Creative Commons

## WeFlow — cc / hicccc77 and contributors (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)

- Project: https://github.com/hicccc77/WeFlow
- Historical source/license:
  https://github.com/hicccc77/WeFlow/tree/fa4edebed63843f6383233a678bf27f327445c79
- Snapshot used by Weport:
  https://github.com/Panther114/WeFlow/commit/642b0e21c62b5c93a3785bd2c6f2349d3470e47a

Weport incorporates and modifies substantial portions of WeFlow, including:

- Electron database, key, media, export, notification, SNS, analytics and
  supporting service code;
- notification-window and Chromium LiquidGlass fallback code;
- native helpers and libraries imported through `resources/key`,
  `resources/wedecrypt`, `resources/welive` and the custom `wcdb_api` wrapper;
- the macOS application icon and the WeFlow media-decoding WASM assets.

The work has been renamed and materially modified. `NOTICE.md` describes the
adaptation and identifies both the original authors and Weport contributors.

## Microsoft Visual C++ runtime

`resources/runtime/win32` contains Microsoft Visual C++ runtime files
(`msvcp140*.dll` and `vcruntime140*.dll`). They are Microsoft redistributable
components, not CC-licensed Weport or WeFlow code. Redistribution is subject to
the applicable Microsoft Visual Studio license terms:

## models.dev — model metadata (MIT)

- Project: https://github.com/anomalyco/models.dev
- Data endpoint: https://models.dev/api.json
- Copyright (c) models.dev contributors
- License: MIT (the repository and its build tooling)

Weport uses models.dev **only as a runtime data source**. No models.dev code is
vendored, imported or shipped:

- `electron/services/ai/modelRegistry.ts` fetches `https://models.dev/api.json`
  at runtime, caches the raw payload under the app's `userData` directory
  (`models-cache.json` + an ETag sidecar), and refreshes it with a conditional
  `GET` on a ~24 h TTL. The cache is deletable at any time and is never
  committed to the repository.
- `electron/assets/models/models-dev-snapshot.json` is a build-time snapshot
  **for offline first-launch only** (regenerate with
  `node scripts/gen-models-snapshot.mjs`). It is data, not code.
- The metadata is informational: model ids, per-model wire protocol, context
  window, output limit, capabilities and published token pricing. It never
  contains user content, and no user data is sent to models.dev.

**Data-usage terms for the aggregated dataset are not documented upstream.**
That is why the full 4.6 MB payload is treated as an expiring cache rather than
a shipped fork, and why only the providers Weport can actually address are
included in the offline snapshot. If upstream publishes terms that conflict with
this usage, deleting `models-cache.json` (and the snapshot) degrades the feature
to the static catalog in `providerCatalog.ts` with no other impact.

## Other npm dependencies

Other production dependencies retain their own license metadata and license
files in their packaged modules. Exact resolved packages and declared SPDX
identifiers are recorded in `package-lock.json`. This project license does not
replace or narrow those third-party licenses.
